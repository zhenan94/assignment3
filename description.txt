List of approach:

1. change the draw methods for mobs and bridges so that it can consistent with buildings and position.

2. fix the building attack. Now, the building can find and attack mobs.

3. add buildings into the target list of mobs.

4. write the uuid generator for mobs.

5. write a to check collisionbetween mobs and the river.
6. implement check collision between mobs and buildings.
7. implement process collision to handle collision:
	1. when mobs have the same mass and are on the same side, the back one will move back.
	2. when mobs have the same mass and are on different sides, both mobs will move back.
	3. when mobs have smaller mass, it will move back.
	4.when mobs have bigger mass, it will keep it current situation.
8. write a method to handle the situation that mobs would push each others into the rivers.
9. write a method to handle the situation mobs are colliding with rivers. The mobs will move along with the river and find the nearest bridge.

What I still like to improve:
1. Try to make that the smaller mobs will move to the side of the bigger mobs instead of moving back.
2. Try to make that the faster mobs can get around the slower mobs in front of them.
